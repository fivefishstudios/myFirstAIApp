According to the Bible, he was born in Bethlehem, Israel, around 2,000 years ago and was crucified on a cross in Jerusalem, where he died and rose again three days later. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, he made the way for people to be reconciled to God and have eternal life. Jesus Christ is considered an important prophet and messenger of God in Islam, as well.\n"
