      "Laura Branigan's 1982 hit single \"Gloria\" achieved platinum status and spent a total of 36 weeks on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, the song was actually a cover version of an original written by Italian singer-songwriters Giancarlo Bigazzi and Umberto Tozzi. On the sports front, after 52 years of waiting, the St. Louis Blues finally clinched their inaugural Stanley Cup win, and their fans celebrated by singing and dancing along to \"Gloria.\" The story behind this is that five players were at a bar and repeatedly asked the DJ to play the song. The bar erupted each time it was played, and the players decided to make it their victory song after a win the following night. They attributed their success to the first time they played \"Gloria\" and continued to play it after every win, quickly making it a fan favorite in St. Louis.\n"
